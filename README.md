# Wumpy

A Discord API wrapper for Python. Wumpy aims to be easy enough for Wumpus, and
extensible enough for Clyde!

## Support

If you have a problem please open a discussion. This is the best place to ask
for help as only bug reports or detailed feature requests should go in the
issue tracker.

Please consider starring the repository, it really helps!

## Goals

The point of Wumpy is to not be in your way as a developer. Extensibility is
considered in all design decisions. If you are thinking about monkey patching
Wumpy please
[open a Discussion](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/discussions/new?category=development)
about what you want to achieve. We can see how Wumpy can suit your needs.

## Contributing

The library is only first now starting to get a good structure. Take a look
at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[the Wiki](https://github.com/Bluenix2/wumpy/wiki) for developer notes and
different design decision write-ups.
