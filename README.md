# Wumpy

A Discord API wrapper for Python. Easy enough for Wumpus, and fast enough for
Clyde! Powered by Cython's Pure Python mode.

## Support

If you have an issue, please open a discussion. This is the best place,
only bug reports or detailed feature requests should go in the issue tracker.

## Goals

The point of Wumpy is to not be in the way. By using C extension classes to
save on memory (and not be in the way of performance) and providing several
ways to inject custom classes Wumpy aims to be as extensible as possible.

## Contributing

I am still very much still figuring out the project still, but very thankful
for any time anyone wishes to use to contribute. Create a discussion or
email me.
