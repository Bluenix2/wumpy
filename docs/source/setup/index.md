# Introduction

The purpose of this guide is to walk you through setting it up a bot and getting it to run.

These steps will not be repeated anywhere else in the documentation, and all documentation is
based around the fact that you have read this.

As always make sure Wumpy is installed:

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/Bluenix2/wumpy
```

After that you can continue to the next page.
