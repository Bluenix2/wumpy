            ### Thank you for opening your first issue! üéâ


            Issues are used to track verified bugs, feature requests that should be worked on,
            and keep tabs on API support. This issue will be added to the
            [organization project][org-project] that contains all issues and PRs in various
            stages.


            You do not need to create an issue for each code-change you want to make, but it
            can be good to ensure that you don't work on the same thing as another person or
            put effort into something that ultimately gets rejected.
